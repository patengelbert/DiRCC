| -------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 30/10/16 | Started some background reading             |                                                                                                          |
| 3/11/16  | Second Meeting                              |                                                                                                          |
| 4/11/16  | Start Work on testing NIOS                  | Turned out Quartus Prime does not support Cyclone III                                                    |
| 7/11/16  | Third Meeting                               | Recieved into to POETS - Still need to get git access                                                    |
| 11/11/16 | More background reading/ Work on NIOS       | Found tutorial on dining philosophes using multiple NIOS and Avalon Memory Mapped bridge (may be useful) |
| 14/11/16 | More work on NIOS                           | Been having issues with Quartus not running on my laptop (time to upgrade Quartus?)                      |
|          | Integrated Quartus with git                 | Took more work than expected                                                                             |
|          | Experimented with C++ on NIOS               | Takes up a lot of space and cannot be optimised as well as a reduced c program (Use c for final program) |
|          | Research into memory allocaation on NIOS    | Each cpu requires seprate code and boot space (can get very large for c++ or large binaries)             |
|          | Made single node NIOS system                | Attempting to run POETS on it fails due to NIOS only supporting single threaded applications             |
|          | Attempted to convert POETS to single thread | Is it worth it? Maybe jump to multi node system                                                          |
|          | Designed node for multi node system         | Use global or node local memory? both?                                                                   |
