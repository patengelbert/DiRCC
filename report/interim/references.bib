  ABSTRACT =      {By adopting a C++ High-Level Synthesis (HLS) flow using Catapult® from Mentor Graphics, NVIDIA® was able to simplify their code by 5X, reduce the number of CPUs required for regression testing by 1000X, and run 1000X more tests to achieve higher functional coverage of their designs. HLS decreased design time by 50 percent and overall development time, including verification, by 40 percent, closing the gap between design complexity and the capacity to design. This paper will discuss the challenges NVIDIA faces in the ever evolving world of video, camera, and display standards and the reasons an HLS/C-level flow make it possible for them to succeed in this context.

abstract = {Hyperscale datacenter providers have struggled to balance the growing need for specialized hardware (efficiency) with the economic benefits of homogeneity (manageability). In this paper we propose a new cloud architecture that uses reconfigurable logic to accelerate both network plane functions and applications. This Configurable Cloud architecture places a layer of reconfigurable logic (FPGAs) between the network switches and the servers, enabling network flows to be programmably transformed at line rate, enabling acceleration of local applications running on the server, and enabling the FPGAs to communicate directly, at datacenter scale, to harvest remote FPGAs unused by their local servers.

We deployed this design over a production server bed, and show how it can be used for both service acceleration (Web search ranking) and network acceleration (encryption of data in transit at high-speeds). This architecture is much more scalable than prior work which used secondary rack-scale networks for inter-FPGA communication. By coupling to the network plane, direct FPGA-to-FPGA messages can be achieved at comparable latency to previous work, without the secondary network. Additionally, the scale of direct inter-FPGA messaging is much larger. The average round-trip latencies observed in our measurements among 24, 1000, and 250,000 machines are under 3, 9, and 20 microseconds, respectively. The Configurable Cloud architecture has been deployed at hyperscale in Microsoft's production datacenters worldwide.},
